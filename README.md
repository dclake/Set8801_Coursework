Coursework assignment for Web Technologies at Edinburgh Naiper University

The assessment requires designing, implementing, and evaluating a website for an online 
quiz. I imagine the Government Ministry of Tourism commissioning a "Do You Know Saint
Lucia?" website for my submission. This website intends to be an interactive learning tool
that will increase the general awareness and knowledge of the Caribbean Island nation of
Saint Lucia and use a quiz to accomplish this aim. The website is therefore aimed primarily
at tourists and visitors to the island. It may be later extended to encourage travel to the
island by offering promotions or coupons to high-scoring visitors but will also be marketed
to locals to promote national pride.  
I have imagined an interactive learning experience where users are presented with multiplechoice
questions and are given immediate feedback with the opportunity to learn more about the topic presented in the question.
